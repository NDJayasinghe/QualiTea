# QualiTea â€“ Automated Tea Quality Assessment
Qualitea is an automated system that evaluates black tea quality by analyzing dry tea particles, brewed tea liquid, and infusion leaves using image processing and machine learning.
The system identifies tea variants, elevation levels, fibers, and strokes, ensuring consistent and objective quality assessment with potential for commercial deployment in tea production lines.

## Features
- Automated detection of tea fibers and particle strokes  
- Extraction of visual features (color, size, shape, texture)  
- Classification using Random Forest, SVM, and Neural Networks  
- High-accuracy recognition of tea variants and elevation levels  
- Modular architecture with front-end (UI) and back-end (processing + ML models)

## System Workflow
